                Windelectric is a credible Nigerian company based in Ogun state, Nigeria and its team is comprised of individuals with wide experience in power generation technologies. We have explored the open source journals of one of the greatest inventors of all time, Nicola Tesla to design & model the Windelectric Magnetic Power Generator (WMPG) .
            <p class="my-4">
                Redefining Electrical Power Generation
                WMPG is an electrical generation system based on magnetic levitation technology. It is equipped with a small battery to initiate rotation of the generator and supporting electronic system operation, no external input power required, thus power generation is realized at extremely low rotation per minute (RPM).</p>
            <p class="my-4">
                WMPG Zero-emission Energy
                Windelectric, a leader in advance zeros emission and greater energy efficiency in electrical power generation sector, and has developed innovative clean Magnetic levitation technology and turn-key solutions for homes, small businesses and commercial or industrial ventures.</p>
