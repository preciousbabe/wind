    <h3>Redefining Electrical Power Energy</h3>
    <p>Redefining Electrical Power Generation
        WMPG is an electrical generation system based on magnetic levitation technology.
         It is equipped with a small battery to initiate rotation of the generator and 
         supporting electronic system operation, no external input power required, thus 
         power generation is realized at extremely low rotation per minute (RPM).</p>

            <h3>WMPG Zero Emission Energy</h3>
       Windelectric, a leader in advance zeros emission and greater energy efficiency 
       in electrical power generation sector, and has developed innovative clean Magnetic
        levitation technology and turn-key solutions for homes, small businesses and commercial 
        or industrial ventures. </p>

        <h3>Free Energy Generation Breakthrough</h3>
         <p>
The Windelectric Magnetic Power Generators (WMPG) provides access to an inexpensive, 
continuously available, and non-polluting method for generating electrical energy with
 scalability to small, medium and large-scale applications. WMPG produces reliable electricity
  non-stop without requiring any fuel input; WMPG are completely hassle free.
WMPG is driven by permanent magnets built on the rotor and control circuits and
 requires no external fossil fuels, nuclear fuels or hydro input.
